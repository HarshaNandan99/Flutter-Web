# Flutter-Web
This file consists of the code that will get the output of an Login Web Page using flutter.
In this i have used Dart Language to create the page.
I have done the UI of the login page.
Created an Container and written the text as "LOGIN PAGE" as the header.
I have inserted an image in one container.
I have created an another Container and inserted two text boxes(one for user id and one for password) and an login logo and also an login button.
